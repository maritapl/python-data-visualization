# python-data-visualization

This repository contains simple and clean Python data visualization examples built using NumPy and Matplotlib.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate statistical visualization techniques and understanding of probability distributions.
1.Gaussian Clusters
Simulates and visualizes three 2D Gaussian (multivariate normal) clusters.
It demonstrates:
Multivariate normal distribution
Effect of covariance on shape and orientation
Cluster centers visualization
Equal axis scaling for accurate geometric representation
Each cluster has:
A different mean (center)
A different covariance matrix (spread + tilt)
2. Histogram with Normal Fit
Generates random data and visualizes:
A histogram displayed as a probability density
An overlaid analytical Normal distribution (PDF) using:
Sample mean
Sample standard deviation
It demonstrates:
Empirical vs theoretical distribution comparison
Density normalization (density=True)
Gaussian probability density function implementation
